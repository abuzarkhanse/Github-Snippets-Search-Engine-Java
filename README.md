# Github-Snippets-Search-Engine-Java

A lightweight and efficient web application that enables developers to quickly find reusable code snippets from public GitHub repositories using keyword-based search and programming language filters.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In modern software development, developers frequently need reusable code snippets to enhance productivity. While GitHub hosts a vast collection of open-source code, finding the right snippet can be time-consuming. This project aims to solve that problem by providing a clean and efficient search engine that fetches and displays relevant code snippets from GitHub based on user input.
